The Plan

* Create a high-quality social graph of the illuminati. Will probably have to be manually verified for accuracy. Starting with about 500 members.
* Assign every member an illuminati score based on proximity to power.
* Add influential ngo's. Link ngo's to database entries of members involved. Add records of funding flow.
* Add events that occur among members to database and link to the database entries of members involved.
* Add twitter, linkedin, facebook and instagram social data to add data about connections between members.

Technical Plan
* Social graph will be stored as a set of nodes and a set of relationships between the nodes. See wiki for more ideas.
